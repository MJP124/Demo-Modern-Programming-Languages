This consist of the Frontend & Backend of my simple project named "Checklist"

The checklist app consists of a Node.js backend that uses Express to handle tasks with endpoints for retrieving and adding tasks, all stored in memory. The React frontend manages the task list, allows users to add and remove tasks, and displays them dynamically, with styling provided via CSS for a clean, centered layout. This design ensures simplicity while enabling easy interaction.
